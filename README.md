Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science used to develop, test and maintain software.
Importance-i) Flexibility and scalability-Ensures that a system is able to handle an increase load without affecting its perfomance
          ii) Reliability- It ensures that a software works/ perfoms as expected.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
i) Mastering compexity
ii) Mastering process
iii) Mastering machine
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
i) Planning- to identify the software purpose and scope
ii) Requirement analysis- identifying the final user specification
iii) Designing- building a framework
iv) Coding- converting software design int a tangible code
v) Testing- examining the software for any bugs and glitches
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology(each phase has to be completed before moving to the next)
i)Low flexibility
ii)The customer feedback comes after the product is developed
iii)Testing is done at the end of the development process
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software developer-Develops applications, programs and systems
-Collaborates with team members
-Reports to the project manager about the progress of the software development
2.Quality Assurance Engineer-collaborates with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement
-Creates development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
3.Project manager- assemles and leads the software team
-Discusses the project with the client the developers/team
-Creates blueprint for the project
-Delivers the software to the client after completion and regurarly checks its performance
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Debugging IDE enables a step through the code, line by line, as it runs and inspect code behavior. IDEs also integrate several debugging tools that highlight bugs caused by human error in real time, even as the developer is typing.
An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. - Some programming languages implement just-in-time compiling, in which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine code from within the application.
Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
 Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints 
Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. 
Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
components.
 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
