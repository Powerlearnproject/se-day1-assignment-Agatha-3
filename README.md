# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science used to develop, test and maintain software.
Importance-i) Flexibility and scalability-Ensures that a system is able to handle an increase load without affecting its perfomance
          ii) Reliability- It ensures that a software works/ perfoms as expected.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
i) Mastering compexity
ii) Mastering process
iii) Mastering machine
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
i) Planning- to identify the software purpose and scope
ii) Requirement analysis- identifying the final user specification
iii) Designing- building a framework
iv) Coding- converting software design int a tangible code
v) Testing- examining the software for any bugs and glitches
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology(each phase has to be completed before moving to the next)
i)Low flexibility
ii)The customer feedback comes after the product is developed
iii)Testing is done at the end of the development process
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software developer-Develops applications, programs and systems
-Collaborates with team members
-Reports to the project manager about the progress of the software development
2.Quality Assurance Engineer-collaborates with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement
-Creates development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
3.Project manager- assemles and leads the software team
-Discusses the project with the client the developers/team
-Creates blueprint for the project
-Delivers the software to the client after completion and regurarly checks its performance
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
